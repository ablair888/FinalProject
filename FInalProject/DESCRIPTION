Description: The package takes data from Kaggle to see if it can be used to decern who is the champion every year. While more than one method of regression would have to be used to correctly pick and machine learning has not accurately picked a bracket, it is getting closer. This package contains four R Scripts which are all necessary for understanding the scope and intention of this project. Again, this project will not guess the winner of future tounrnament. What it does do is take the data and aggregate traits that would be most useful in identifying what traits Champions and tournament teams share.
